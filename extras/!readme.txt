Hi Roy!
Begin with tbot_login.html and just follow the links from there.
There are still some bugs in the javascript that might show up, depending on the sequence in which you proceed through the pages, entering data along the way.
Many of the buttons look funky in ways that I didn't intend!
Sometimes the outputted date is a day earlier than that entered, because of a glitch in my conversion between UTC and NST.
